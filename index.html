        <p>The word personality itself stems from the Latin word persona, which referred to a theatrical mask worn by performers in order to either project different roles or disguise their identities. A brief definition is that personality is made up of the characteristic patterns of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that make a person unique. In addition to this, personality arises from within the individual and remains fairly consistent throughout life. While there are many different definitions of personality, most focus on the pattern of behaviors and characteristics that can help predict and explain a person's behavior. Explanations for personality can focus on a variety of influences, ranging from genetic explanations for personality traits to the role of the environment and experience in shaping an individual's personality.<br><br>
The research of “oneself” is one of the existential question that keep going on in the history and in the philosophical field in particular. 
The idea of define different typologies of people is the most common application to the research of “oneself”. Through that we are trying not to understand our specific personality, but trying to map out some of our main characteristic.<br><br>
An interesting aspect about personality test, is how they are changing through the time.<br><br>
The first personality test was the physiognomy. Physiognomy (from the Greek φύσις physis meaning "nature" and gnomon meaning "judge" or "interpreter") is a practice of assessing a person's character or personality from their outer appearance—especially the face.<br><br>
The practice was well accepted by the ancient Greek philosophers, but fell into disrepute in the Middle Ages when practised by vagabonds and mountebanks. It was then revived and popularised by Johann Kaspar Lavater before falling from favour again in the late 19th century. The first systematic physiognomic treatise to survive to the present day is a slim volume, Physiognomonica (English: Physiognomonics), ascribed to Aristotle (but probably of his "school" rather than created by the philosopher himself). The volume is divided into two parts, conjectured to have been originally two separate works. The first section discusses arguments drawn from nature or other races, and concentrates on the concept of human behavior. The second section focuses on animal behavior, dividing the animal kingdom into male and female types. From these are deduced correspondences between human form and character.<br><br>
This way of mapping the personality is just the first example of predict the possible action of behavior and in particular this test, is not aiming to understand oneself but just to  create a separation between good and bad, right and wrong.<br><br> 
After this kind of test and in particular thanks to the diffusion of medias as newspaper, the idea of doing test became a way to understand personal quality. One fascinating example is in the May issue of The Girl Friend ( and The Boy Friend ) a pulp magazine, that had offered 2 gender specific tests for its readers in 1953. The quiz, strictly for girls, asked the question “What are Your Best Fitted for: Love or Career.”<br><br> 
These kind of quiz, were a way to choose which path of life was better for a woman, if the carrier or the marriage. This test is a reflection of the misogyny present in the 1950’, and  show that the research of one’s personality is obviously also a reflection of the society. Personality test can be seens as a way to trace the need of the human being through the time and how this need is shifting, but in particular is shaping our role into the society.<br><br> 
Nowadays we are completely overlapped by any kind of quiz. But the question that we want to pose from this research, is what are we searching while doing this kind of test?We are probably looking for something specific, and probably the answer to what we are looking for while doing a test can be the only trace of our personality in this activity.<br><br> 
After analysing and understanding the broad possibilities of personality test, we would like to propose a new test to explain in a surprising and funny way the different psychological approach of people doing a test.  
What is the deep need of people doing this different kind of test? 
Which spectrum of the multiple self are you today?<br><br> 
This title can lead to different perceptions and possible results, but in reality we are going to show some of the recorrent possible reason why people choose to do quizzes.<br><br> 

Why is so intriguing for all of us to do quiz and see the results? 
This test is a way to highlight the psychological approach, but in a playful and ironic way.<br><br> 
We choose accurately the questions and the answer.<br><br> 
A little bit of fun and little bit of reflection to create self awareness.<br><br> 
Test yours.
